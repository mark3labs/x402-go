# Implementation Plan: MCP Integration

**Branch**: `007-mcp-integration` | **Date**: 2025-10-31 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/007-mcp-integration/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Integrate MCP (Model Context Protocol) support into x402-go by creating client transport and server implementations that handle x402 payment flows transparently. The implementation will reuse existing x402-go signers, facilitator client, and types while adapting the payment flow patterns from mcp-go-x402 reference implementation.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Go 1.25.1  
**Primary Dependencies**: github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go (latest stable release - MCP protocol), existing x402-go components  
**Storage**: N/A (stateless middleware and transport)  
**Testing**: Go test with race detection, table-driven tests  
**Target Platform**: Linux/macOS servers running MCP services  
**Project Type**: single (library with subpackages)  
**Performance Goals**: Payment verification under 5 seconds, settlement under 60 seconds  
**Constraints**: No additional external dependencies beyond mcp-go, must reuse existing x402-go components  
**Scale/Scope**: ~1000 lines new code (leveraging existing components), support concurrent payments

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- ✅ **No Unnecessary Documentation**: Only creating spec-related docs and API contracts
- ✅ **Test Coverage Preservation**: Will include comprehensive unit tests for all new code
- ✅ **Test-First Development**: Will write tests before implementing MCP transport and server
- ✅ **Stdlib-First Approach**: Using only mcp-go dependency (required for protocol), reusing x402-go
- ✅ **Code Conciseness**: Reusing existing signers, facilitator, types - minimal new code
- ✅ **Binary Cleanup**: Examples will be tested but binaries not committed

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure with MCP subpackages. This follows Go conventions and allows clean separation between client and server components while maximizing code reuse from existing x402-go packages.
