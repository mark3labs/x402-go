# Tasks: MCP Integration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/007-mcp-integration/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are included as requested in the original specification ("Add tests").

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: Repository root with subpackages
- Main code: `mcp/client/`, `mcp/server/` at repository root
- Examples: `examples/mcp/`
- Tests: Alongside source files with `_test.go` suffix

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create MCP package directory structure at mcp/ in repository root
- [ ] T002 [P] Create mcp/types.go for MCP-specific type aliases and constants
- [ ] T003 [P] Create mcp/errors.go for MCP-specific error types
- [ ] T004 [P] Create mcp/client and mcp/server subdirectories

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 and US2 are both P1 priority and can proceed in parallel
  - US3 (P2) can start after Foundational, integrates with US1
  - US4 (P3) depends on US1 and US2 being complete
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Enhances US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Depends on US1 and US2 - Demonstrates their functionality

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Base types before complex implementations
- Core logic before integration points
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Foundational tasks T008, T009 can run in parallel
- US1 and US2 can be developed in parallel (both P1)
- All tests within a user story can run in parallel
- Polish phase tasks can all run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3 & 4 in parallel: User Story 1 (Client) and User Story 2 (Server)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test client-server interaction
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 & 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test multi-chain ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Provide examples ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Client)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Server)
   - Developer C: Can start User Story 3 tests
3. After US1 & US2 complete:
   - Any developer: User Story 4 (Examples)
   - All developers: Polish phase

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Tests included as requested in original specification
- US1 and US2 are both P1 priority and form the MVP together
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Total tasks: 78 (excluding parallel markers) - includes timeout, concurrent payment, edge case, and non-refundable payment tasks
