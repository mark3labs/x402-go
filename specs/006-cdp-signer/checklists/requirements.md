# Specification Quality Checklist: Coinbase CDP Signer Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: Thu Oct 30 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Review
- ✅ Specification focuses on WHAT (CDP wallet signing with account creation) and WHY (secure key management, production reliability) without implementation HOW
- ✅ All sections written for business stakeholders - describes user needs and business value
- ✅ No code examples, specific libraries, or implementation approaches included
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete and detailed

### Requirement Completeness Review
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete and actionable
- ✅ All 24 functional requirements are testable with clear pass/fail criteria
- ✅ Success criteria include specific measurable thresholds (3 seconds account creation, 2 seconds initialization, 500ms signing, 100 concurrent requests, etc.)
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details - focus on observable outcomes (timing, error rates, supported networks, no duplicates)
- ✅ 6 prioritized user stories with complete acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format
- ✅ 14 edge cases identified covering failures, timeouts, concurrency, account creation race conditions, and operational issues
- ✅ Clear scope boundaries defined (In Scope vs Out of Scope) to prevent scope creep
- ✅ 19 assumptions documented covering prerequisite knowledge, environmental conditions, and account creation patterns
- ✅ Dependencies clearly listed (CDP API with account creation endpoints, credentials, libraries, existing interfaces)

### Feature Readiness Review
- ✅ Each functional requirement directly maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✅ User scenarios cover all critical flows: Account creation (P1), EVM signing (P1), SVM signing (P2), security (P1), error handling (P2), multi-chain (P3)
- ✅ Success criteria are directly verifiable: timing thresholds, supported network counts, error handling percentages, interface compatibility, duplicate prevention
- ✅ No implementation leakage - even technical sections (Non-Functional Requirements) describe outcomes not implementation approaches

### Changes Made (User Feedback Integration)
- ✅ Added User Story 5 (P1): Account Creation and Retrieval - addressing requirement that accounts cannot be created via CDP Portal
- ✅ Added FR-001 through FR-006: Functional requirements for CreateOrGetAccount helper, account creation for EVM/SVM, and duplicate prevention
- ✅ Renumbered remaining functional requirements (FR-007 through FR-024) to accommodate new account creation requirements
- ✅ Added CDP Account entity to Key Entities section
- ✅ Added 5 new success criteria (SC-001, SC-004, SC-005, SC-006, SC-019) for account creation timing, network support, retrieval speed, and duplicate prevention
- ✅ Renumbered remaining success criteria (SC-002 through SC-018)
- ✅ Added 4 new edge cases related to account creation race conditions, multiple accounts, lost responses, and invalid networks
- ✅ Updated In Scope to include account creation, retrieval, and idempotent operations
- ✅ Updated Out of Scope to remove incorrect assumption about portal-based account creation
- ✅ Updated Assumptions to clarify that accounts are created programmatically, not via portal
- ✅ Updated Dependencies to include CDP API account creation endpoints

## Summary

**Status**: ✅ APPROVED - Specification is complete and ready for planning phase

All checklist items pass validation. The specification successfully:
- Defines clear user value across 6 prioritized stories (including critical account creation)
- Establishes 24 testable functional requirements (6 for account management, 18 for signing and operations)
- Sets 19 measurable success criteria with concrete thresholds
- Identifies scope boundaries, edge cases (including account creation scenarios), and dependencies
- Maintains technology-agnostic language focused on outcomes
- Correctly reflects CDP's requirement that accounts must be created via API, not portal

**Next Steps**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan.
