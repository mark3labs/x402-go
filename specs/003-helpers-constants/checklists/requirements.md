# Specification Quality Checklist: Helper Functions and Constants

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items passed. The specification is complete and ready for planning.

### Validation Details:

**Content Quality**: ✓
- Spec focuses entirely on developer experience (WHAT they can achieve)
- No mention of Go-specific implementation, function signatures, or code structure
- Written to describe value: "reducing friction", "time-consuming", "error-prone"
- All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions

**Requirement Completeness**: ✓
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete
- Each FR is testable (e.g., FR-001 can be verified by checking constant availability)
- Success criteria include specific metrics (10 lines, 15 lines, 100%, zero errors, 8 chains)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focused on developer experience, not Go syntax)
- 15 acceptance scenarios across 4 user stories cover all core flows
- Edge cases address: testnet/mainnet mixing, contract upgrades, network mismatches, defaults
- Scope clearly bounded (helpers for setup, not validation; constants for current addresses)
- Assumptions documented: USDC is primary token, 6 decimals, address stability

**Feature Readiness**: ✓
- Each FR maps to acceptance scenarios (e.g., FR-004 → User Story 2 scenarios)
- User scenarios prioritized (P1: client setup, middleware setup; P2: token config; P3: validation)
- SC-001 through SC-005 provide measurable outcomes for feature success
- No implementation leakage (no mention of struct fields, package layout, function signatures)
