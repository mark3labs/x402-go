# Implementation Plan: Gin Middleware for x402 Payment Protocol

**Branch**: `004-gin-middleware` | **Date**: 2025-10-29 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-gin-middleware/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Create a Gin-compatible middleware that enforces x402 payment gating on protected routes. The middleware will delegate payment verification and settlement to the existing FacilitatorClient (http/facilitator.go), reuse shared utilities from http/handler.go for parsing and error responses, and follow the Coinbase reference implementation's response writer pattern to intercept handler output before settlement.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Go 1.25.1  
**Primary Dependencies**: Gin (github.com/gin-gonic/gin), existing x402-go core package  
**Storage**: N/A (stateless middleware, payment tracking delegated to facilitator)  
**Testing**: go test with race detection (-race flag)  
**Target Platform**: Any platform supporting Go HTTP servers (Linux, macOS, Windows)
**Project Type**: Single project (library/SDK)  
**Performance Goals**: Payment verification <5s, settlement <60s (delegated to facilitator)  
**Constraints**: Zero state management, delegate all payment logic to facilitator  
**Scale/Scope**: Per-request middleware, no user tracking or session management

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Initial Check (Pre-Research)

#### ✅ Principle I: No Unnecessary Documentation
- Status: PASS
- Rationale: Documentation is explicitly requested through the spec/plan workflow

#### ✅ Principle II: Test Coverage Preservation
- Status: PASS
- Rationale: New package will have comprehensive tests (see User Stories), existing coverage unaffected

#### ✅ Principle III: Test-First Development
- Status: PASS
- Rationale: Acceptance scenarios in spec provide test cases; tests will be written before implementation

#### ✅ Principle IV: Stdlib-First Approach
- Status: PASS with justified exception
- Rationale: Gin framework is required per user request and spec; it's the feature itself, not an unnecessary abstraction. All other functionality delegates to existing stdlib-based code (http/facilitator.go, http/handler.go)

#### ✅ Principle V: Code Conciseness
- Status: PASS
- Rationale: Implementation will delegate to existing code (FacilitatorClient, parsePaymentHeader, sendPaymentRequired) rather than duplicating logic. Minimal Gin-specific adapter code needed.

#### ✅ Principle VI: Binary Cleanup
- Status: PASS
- Rationale: No binaries will be created; this is library code only

---

### Post-Design Check (After Phase 1)

#### ✅ Principle I: No Unnecessary Documentation
- Status: PASS (Confirmed)
- Artifacts Created: research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/gin-middleware-api.yaml
- Justification: All artifacts required by the spec/plan workflow for implementation guidance

#### ✅ Principle II: Test Coverage Preservation
- Status: PASS (Confirmed)
- Evidence: Design includes 10+ test scenarios (research.md "Testing Strategy") covering all acceptance criteria
- New package in http/gin/ won't affect existing coverage

#### ✅ Principle III: Test-First Development
- Status: PASS (Confirmed)
- Test Strategy Documented: Table-driven tests, mock facilitator, response writer verification, browser detection
- Ready for implementation: All test cases identified before code writing

#### ✅ Principle IV: Stdlib-First Approach
- Status: PASS (Confirmed)
- Design Analysis: 
  - Gin framework: Required (feature scope)
  - FacilitatorClient: Reused from http/facilitator.go (stdlib http.Client wrapper)
  - parsePaymentHeader: Reused from http/handler.go (stdlib base64 + json)
  - No new external dependencies beyond Gin
- Delegation verified: 90%+ of logic reuses existing stdlib-based code

#### ✅ Principle V: Code Conciseness
- Status: PASS (Confirmed)
- Design Metrics:
  - New code: ~200 lines (middleware.go + responseWriter)
  - Reused code: ~400 lines (facilitator + handler + types)
  - Reuse ratio: 2:1 (existing:new)
- Comments: Design includes only "why" comments (e.g., "Buffer response for atomic payment semantics")

#### ✅ Principle VI: Binary Cleanup
- Status: PASS (Confirmed)
- No build artifacts: Library package only, no executables

**GATE RESULT**: ✅ ALL PRINCIPLES PASS - Ready for Phase 2 (Tasks Generation)

```

**Structure Decision**: Single project library structure. New code lives in `http/gin/` subdirectory to organize framework-specific middleware separately from stdlib implementation. This follows Go convention of framework adapters in subdirectories (e.g., `net/http/pprof`, `net/http/cgi`). Maximum code reuse from existing http package components.
