# Specification Quality Checklist: Gin Middleware for x402 Payment Protocol

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **Pass** - Specification focuses on what developers need (payment gating for Gin apps) and why (protect endpoints, monetize APIs). Written in terms of user scenarios, not code structure.

✅ **Pass** - All mandatory sections are completed with concrete details.

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **Pass** - All functional requirements are specific and testable (e.g., "MUST return HTTP 402 with payment requirements JSON", "MUST convert decimal USDC amount to integer representation").

✅ **Pass** - Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
- SC-001: Single function call (countable)
- SC-002: 100% of test scenarios (binary pass/fail)
- SC-003: Within 60 seconds (time duration)
- SC-007: Fewer than 10 lines (countable)
- SC-008: Zero precision loss (binary)

✅ **Pass** - All user stories have acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format with clear outcomes.

✅ **Pass** - Edge cases identified: facilitator unavailability, malformed headers, insufficient payment, route group behavior, settlement failures, CORS, replay attacks.

✅ **Pass** - Scope is clearly bounded with detailed "Out of Scope" section (8 items explicitly excluded).

✅ **Pass** - Dependencies (Gin framework, facilitator client, USDC contracts) and assumptions (testnet default, stateless payments, HTTP/HTTPS serving) are documented.

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **Pass** - Each of the 20 functional requirements maps to acceptance scenarios in the user stories.

✅ **Pass** - Four user stories (P1-P3) cover: basic payment gating, configuration, context integration, and browser support.

✅ **Pass** - All success criteria focus on observable outcomes without mentioning implementation.

✅ **Pass** - No code structure, package names (except location), or API details in requirements.

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, clear, and ready for planning phase.

The spec successfully adapts the Coinbase reference implementation while maintaining consistency with our existing x402-go patterns (facilitator client reuse, configuration options, error handling).

No clarifications needed - the spec provides sufficient detail for developers to understand what to build without prescribing how to build it.
